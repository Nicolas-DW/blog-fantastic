description : "a poem about the leaf"

When I was walking,  
I saw a leaf.  

It was lying on the ground.  
I thought, "It's just a leaf,"  
And I tried to pass by.  

It was then, in that moment,  
I knew that  
For every step thereafter,  
This leaf would be with me.  

This leaf will never  
Leave me alone,  
For the rest of my life.  

This leaf was indeed  
With me  
From my birth  
To my death.
