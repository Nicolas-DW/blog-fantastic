Hating yourself  
Does more harm than good.  

Don't heed the monkey  
Inside your head,  
For it seeks to  
Destroy you.  

Many people  
Love you.  

Listen to them,  
Love them,  
Be grateful that  
Despite your perceived flaws,  
They remain by your side.  

You hate yourself because  
Your heart is too fragile,  
You perceive too much,  
And lack the strength  
To follow through.  

Be grateful to them;  
They bring out your beauty.  
You are defined by your loved ones,  
Even in silence.  

Love them,  
Stay alive.
