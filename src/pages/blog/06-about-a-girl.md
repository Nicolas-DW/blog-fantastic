description : "a poem about the girl I love"

True love is not an easy thing  

I don't want to hurt her  
I'm afraid of doing her harm  

Feelings intensify  
The heart is fragile  
Everything matters  
Nothing is futile to me  

I love the way she walks  
I love the aura that surrounds her  
Like a plant in the sea  
She is my fortress  
The church is in my heart  

When I look at the sea  
I see clouds  
Covering my hopes within  

The moon shines  
Revealing a silhouette  
Of her  
Far in the ocean  

I yell to tell her  
That I love her  
The storm rumbles  
The clouds draw near  
And the waves grow high  

One day I will go to join her  
There, far on the horizon  
To bring her the love I feel  

The leaf is beside me  
It hurts me  
It covers my mouth  
It covers my mind  

Every day I tell her  
That I love her  
And maybe one day  
The leaf will go away  

Meanwhile  
The treasure of my heart  
Spreads throughout my body  

Every day I tell her I love her  
One day  
I will show her my heart  
Free from the leaf 

I love you Marie
