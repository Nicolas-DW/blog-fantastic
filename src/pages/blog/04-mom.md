description : "a poem about my mom"

I miss my mom.  

I wasn't there enough;  
I didn't care for her as I should have.  

She was the kindest person on earth,  
Always there for me  
Every day of my life.  
Her eyes were the epitome of love.  

She bore the leaf,  
Passed it to me.  
Now, I carry this leaf  
For the rest of my life.  

The leaf brought her pain,  
Affecting her family.  
In the past, her sister  
Couldn't withstand  
The leaf's sharp edge.  

The world here is cruel.  
I don't understand why she left  
So young, so soon.  

Perhaps the best depart first;  
Maybe that's the reason.  

I yearn to tell her,  
Just once more,  
That I love her and  
Think of her with every heartbeat.  

Mom, I love you,  
And I miss you dearly.
