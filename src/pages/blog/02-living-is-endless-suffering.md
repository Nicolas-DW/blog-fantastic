description : "a poem about being tired of living"
---

From my birth until now,  
I can't recall  
A single moment  
Without suffering.  

I don't belong here,  
I am not from this place.  

I am distasteful and foolish,  
Dreaming of stars in the sky,  
Yet I'm already beneath the ground.  

Be cautious,  
If you encounter me on the bridge,  
For I have already  
Passed away.
