Hating yourself
Does more hurting than good

Don't listen to the monkey
Inside your head
Because he is trying to
Destroy you

Lots of people
Love you

Listen to them
Love them
Be gratefull that
Despite your horrible
Real face
They still stick around

You hate yourself because
Your heart is too fragile
Because you see too much things
And because
You don't have
The strength to follow-up

Be gratefull to them
They make you beautifull
You are your loved ones
Even if you do not talk to them

Love them
Stay alive
