description : "a poem about the love I don't give enough"
---

I am not gentle with my loved ones  
The closer they are  
the more cruel I become  

It's as if my heart  
burns hotter when it's near  

I must learn  
to be kinder  
gentler and more flexible  
towards those who deserve it the most  

I don't tell you often enough  
but I love you with all my heart  
even those I do not see  
even those I never see  
even those I no longer see  

I love you.
